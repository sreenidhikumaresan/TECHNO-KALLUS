                        1 package (15.5 oz) chocolate chip biscuits, crushed<br>
                        6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br>

                        1 cup granulated sugar<br>
                        1/4 cup packed light brown sugar<br>
                        4 large eggs<br>
                        1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>

                        Instructions:<br>

                        Prepare the crust: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a medium bowl, combine the crushed chocolate chip biscuits and melted butter. Press the mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake for 10 minutes, then set aside to cool.   <br>
                        Make the filling: In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Gradually add the granulated sugar and brown sugar, beating until well combined. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.<br>

                        Bake: Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the cheesecake is set around the edges but still slightly jiggly in the center. Turn off the oven and leave the cheesecake inside for an hour to cool gradually. <br>  
                        Refrigerate: Refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours, or overnight, before serving.<br>
                        Optional toppings: Serve with a dollop of whipped cream, a drizzle of chocolate sauce, or fresh berries<br>
